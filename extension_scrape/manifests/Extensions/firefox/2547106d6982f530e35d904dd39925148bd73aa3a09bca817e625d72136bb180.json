Inserts a table of averages under Player Game Logs and Team Game Logs, NBA and College. The inserted table has the same columns and the same number of rows as the game log. If the 'To Game' option is selected, the row for Game #N (the Nth game in the table) displays averages for Game #1 (the first game in the table) through Game #N. If 'From Game' is selected, the row for Game #N displays averages for Game #N through the last game in the table. If a game row is clicked: With 'To Game' selected, averages are calculated from that game instead of Game #1; With 'From Game' selected, averages are calculated to that game instead of the last game in the table. Click that same game again, or the first or last game, to reset. If the game log is sorted (by clicking on a column heading), the inserted table will also be sorted, and averages recalculated based on the new order of games. The sort column will be copied to the inserted table, making it easy to identify and select ranges based on the sort column. To make it easier to sort the inserted table, the game log can be collapsed, leaving only its column headings. Click the heading of an inserted table (e.g., '2018-19 Regular Season Averages') to hide/show the table and, if local storage is available, all tables of its type (NBA Regular Season, NBA Playoffs, or College). The add-on wasn't developed with mobile devices in mind, but it seems to be working properly in Firefox for Android.", "content_scripts": [{"matches": ["*://www.basketball-reference.com/*", "*://www.sports-reference.com/*"], "js": ["addStats.js"], "run_at": "document_idle"}]}
