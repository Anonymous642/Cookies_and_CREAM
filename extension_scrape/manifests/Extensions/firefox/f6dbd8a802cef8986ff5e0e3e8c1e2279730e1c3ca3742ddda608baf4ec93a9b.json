{"manifest_version": 3, "name": "Copy Extension", "version": "1.0", "description": "The extension consists of a popup window that opens when the user clicks on the extension icon in the browser toolbar. The popup window contains a button labeled 'Add', which, when clicked, adds a new text input field to the window. Each input field also has a 'Copy' button next to it, which, when clicked, copies the contents of the input field to the clipboard. To remove a specific input field, the user can click on a 'Remove' button next to the input field. This will remove the input field from the window. The extension uses JavaScript and the browser's built-in storage APIs to store the contents of the input fields and retrieve them when the popup window is opened or closed. This ensures that the user's inputs are not lost when they close the popup window or reload the extension.", "icons": {"16": "icon16.png", "48": "icon48.png", "128": "icon128.png"}, "action": {"default_icon": "icon48.png", "default_popup": "popup.html"}, "permissions": ["activeTab", "storage"], "browser_specific_settings": {"gecko": {"id": "{daf48bf7-1966-d965-0899-91cf07434c3d}"}}}
