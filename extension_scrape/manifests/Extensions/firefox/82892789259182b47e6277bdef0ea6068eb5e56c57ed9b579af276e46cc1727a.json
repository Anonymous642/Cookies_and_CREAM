{"name": "Tab Shortcuts", "version": "1.0", "description": "Forked from mortalis13's Close Tabs Shortcuts, so big thanks to him. All my version does differently is change the hotkeys to something I'm more comfortable with, and maybe you too. Oh, and add a crummy icon. This extension allows you to close all unfocused tabs, close all tabs to the left of your focused tab, and close all tabs to the right of your focused tab. Close to Left is Ctrl+Shift+Left, Close to Right is Ctrl+Shift+Right, and Close all unfocused tabs is Ctrl+Shift+Up.", "icons": {"48": "icons/tab_short.png"}, "applications": {"gecko": {"id": "mayvall3y@outlook.com"}}, "manifest_version": 2, "background": {"scripts": ["utils.js", "background.js"]}, "commands": {"close-other-tabs": {"suggested_key": {"default": "Ctrl+Shift+Up"}, "description": "Close Unfocused Tabs"}, "close-left-tabs": {"suggested_key": {"default": "Ctrl+Shift+Left"}, "description": "Close Tabs to the Left"}, "close-right-tabs": {"suggested_key": {"default": "Ctrl+Shift+Right"}, "description": "Close Tabs to the Right"}}, "permissions": ["tabs"]}
