{"manifest_version": 2, "name": "sn-nav", "version": "2.0", "description": "Improves the navigation within ServiceNow in two ways. The first is it overrides ServiceNow's implementation of shared history navigation with the browser's native implementation. This means you can now have more than one tab open and not worry about how history in one tab will impact the other. The second improvement is with the rendering of breadcrumbs at the top of the page for easy navigation between a record and the table it is stored within. This will only run on domains that match *://*.service-now.com/*. Note: This extension is effectively in 'alpha' state. I created it to solve my own pains with ServiceNow's terrible implementation of history navigation. I am sharing this with others in hopes it will improve your life as well. I have no guarantees that it will work for you. Report bugs if you encounter any. And please be kind; I am under no obligation to help and share.", "icons": {"16": "icons/favicon-16x16.png", "32": "icons/favicon-32x32.png"}, "content_scripts": [{"matches": ["*://*.service-now.com/*"], "js": ["main.js"]}], "options_ui": {"page": "options.html"}, "permissions": ["storage"], "browser_specific_settings": {"gecko": {"id": "{c1acbbff-f104-46b4-845c-9a43a570fafe}"}}}
