{"manifest_version": 2, "name": "Fake News Fighter", "description": "I'm tired of the extreme bype both Fox News and CNN have placed into the news. It's constantly breaking news, even if it isn't important. There's giant headlines to grab my attention that doen't deserve it. Opinions are places on to the sites. There are headlines that are questions. They try to explain things to me like I am five years old (I'm not). They will write stories about other sites and say it is fake news (I already knew). I can't stand the news anymore. So I have written this plugin to remove all of the things I personally hate. After running this plugin, it will feel like you were transported back 20 years when news was actually reported.", "version": "1.0", "icons": {"48": "48icon.png", "96": "96icon.png"}, "content_scripts": [{"matches": ["*://cnn.com/*", "*://foxnews.com/*", "*://www.cnn.com/*", "*://www.foxnews.com/*"], "js": ["content.js"], "run_at": "document_end"}, {"matches": ["*://cnn.com/*", "*://foxnews.com/*", "*://www.cnn.com/*", "*://www.foxnews.com/*"], "js": ["content.js"], "run_at": "document_idle"}]}
