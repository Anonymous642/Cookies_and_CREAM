{"manifest_version": 2, "name": "Icelandic news filter", "version": "1.0", "description": "Are you tired of endless COVID-19 or volcanic eruption news? Then this is the extension for you. It simply filters out and removes news items so you don't have to see them. It is currently only supported for www.mbl.is. When you navigate to www.mbl.is, a filter icon will show up in your address bar. When pressed, it will show you three options: toggle filter for COVID-19 news, toggle filter for volcanic eruption news and a button to turn off all filters. When you turn on a filter, matching news items will disappear from the page. They will come back once you turn off the filter. That's it, go and enjoy viewing www.mbl.is without these endless COVID-19 and volcanic eruption news! Note: The current version of this extension will not rememeber your previous filter choice when you return to www.mbl.is, so make sure to turn the filter back on when you reload the page.", "homepage_url": "https://github.com/SmariF89/IcelandicNewsFilter", "icons": {"48": "icons/filter.png"}, "permissions": ["activeTab"], "page_action": {"browser_style": true, "default_icon": "icons/filter.png", "default_title": "Icelandic news filter", "default_popup": "popup/choose_news_type.html", "show_matches": ["https://*.mbl.is/*"]}}
