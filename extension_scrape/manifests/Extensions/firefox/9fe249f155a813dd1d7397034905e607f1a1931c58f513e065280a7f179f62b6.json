{"name": "JSON Formatter + Viewer", "version": "1.4", "manifest_version": 2, "description": "JSON Formatter extension is designed to help you view JSON data on web pages in a more readable format. If you frequently encounter JSON data on web pages, you may find it difficult to read and understand, as the data is often presented in a compact and unformatted manner. JSON Formatter aims to solve this problem by formatting the JSON data on the same page, making it easier for you to read and understand. To use JSON Formatter, simply click on the extension icon in the toolbar. The extension will then format any JSON data that it detects on the page. The formatted data will be displayed in a separate section on the same page, with proper indentation and formatting. The extension will also set a badge on the extension icon indicating that the JSON data was successfully formatted. It's worth noting that this extension only works on pages with JSON content. If the page does not have any JSON data, the extension will not do anything. Additionally, the extension does not modify or alter the original JSON data in any way - it only formats it for easier readability. If you need to copy or modify the original JSON data, you can do so by viewing the page source or using the browser's developer tools. Overall, JSON Formatter is a useful tool for anyone who frequently works with JSON data on the web. It's simple to use and can save you a lot of time and effort by making the data easier to read and understand.", "icons": {"16": "icon16.png", "48": "icon16.png", "128": "icon16.png"}, "permissions": ["activeTab", "tabs"], "background": {"scripts": ["background.js"], "persistent": false}, "content_scripts": [{"matches": ["<all_urls>"], "js": ["content.js"]}], "browser_action": {"default_icon": "icon16.png"}, "browser_specific_settings": {"gecko": {"id": "{a8176ee8-5f13-4a84-a667-7f370c0396b0}"}}}
