Ensure that you are logged in to youtube in the browser. Once you search something or start watching videos related to some topic like cars, mobiles etc. or listen to some songs, youtube keeps on recommending similar type of videos. But if we delete the old history, youtube will eventually give us new recommendations. Note that this extension doesnot have UI; it just runs in the background. To disable it just go to the extensions page of your browser.", "background": {"scripts": ["background.js"]}, "permissions": ["*://myactivity.google.com/*"]}
