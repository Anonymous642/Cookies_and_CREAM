This spectaculous extension searches server Odysee.com for query text you will supply to it throught address bar (by entering it with input device/method of your choice and clicking small, bottomy thingy with 'astronaut' icon afterwards).

Once they get them, it is only matter of time (fraction of seconds usually [guarantion (or exact timing) is not part of licence agreement]) for those lovely creatures to put them in front of your eyes in form of 'search result page' (tm) from server Odysee.com - that is the original server this addon is designated for.", "applications": {"gecko": {"id": "search-odysee.com@jirka-justra.cz"}}, "icons": {"96": "icons/96.png", "180": "icons/180.png"}, "chrome_settings_overrides": {"search_provider": {"name": "odysee.com", "search_url": "https://odysee.com/$/search?q={searchTerms}", "keyword": "odysee", "favicon_url": "https://odysee.com/public/favicon-spaceman.png"}}}
