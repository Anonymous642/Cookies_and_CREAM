On Youtube.com, the default setting for autoplay is on. When you set it to off, sometimes it reverts to 'on' after a while. And you don't want to log in to have access to your personal settings or you use private mode often, you probably need to click the autoplay switch quite often. Use this extension to click it for you when autoplay is on.", "icons": {"48": "icons/icon48.png", "96": "icons/icon96.png"}, "applications": {"gecko": {"id": "{9e0cd826-dd57-4e30-b357-5efc139ad9dd}"}}, "content_scripts": [{"matches": ["*://*.youtube.com/*"], "js": ["stopautoplay.js"]}]}
