{"description": "Changes happy, uncustomized neopets' images to their older, non-fist-clenching versions.  I made this addon because I missed the old poses, they had so much personality to them.  Now you can see them again for any neopet with an older version (so no colors created post-customization update will be eligible for a reversion obviously) who is both uncustomized and happy (so no starving neopets).  If any color/species combos are missing that DID have an older image, feel free to say so in a review with a link to the image that is missing.  Once I see it I will add it!", "manifest_version": 2, "name": "Neopet Images to Old Versions", "version": "1.0", "web_accessible_resources": ["images/*.gif"], "content_scripts": [{"matches": ["*://*.neopets.com/*"], "js": ["oldify.js"]}]}
